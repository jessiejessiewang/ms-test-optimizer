Morgan Stanley Delta One Team - Coding Test

### Coding Test

Requirements: Finish independently, internet/google/stackoverflow etc. available. No cooperation, no
copy & paste.

#### Project:
Use python to write an optimizer.

#### Requirements:
1. Suppose we initially have a basket of $10 million CSI300 underlying stocks, with equal weights.
2. Use Markowitz optimization to build a portfolio, maximize future return and minimize risk.
3. For risk calculation, you can either use Barra Data (if you have), or past 5 years daily data to
calculate Cov matrix.
4. Each component weight should deviate from CSI300 weight less than 3%.
5. Turnover rate should be less than 15%.
6. For alpha, you can generate random number, alpha itself is not important.

#### Result:
1. Please make sure your script can run without error.
2. Please hand in the full code as well as outputs.
3. Please save Input/Output as csv, and code as txt file.
